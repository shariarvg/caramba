Movie 1:
Did you change your hair?No.You might wanna think about itI missed you.It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.With the teeth of your zipper?You the new guy?So they tell me...C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.So -- which Dakota you from?North, actually.  How'd you   ?I was kidding. People actually live there?Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.How many people were in your old school?Thirty-two.Get out!How many people go here?Couple thousand. Most of them evilThat I'm used to.Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.That girl -- I --You burn, you pine, you perish?Who is she?Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about itWhy not?I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...Tempestuous?No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.Who's that?Patrick Verona   Random skid.That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.He always look soBlock E?Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.Just a little.What's this?An attempted slit.I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very little further than the occasional smarmy smile of a young woman to make a living.  I'm sure there's a problem. I mean, people get pretty mad at you for it, but...I'm not going to get mad at you.  You're the only one who can stand up to this. I'm not saying you're not capable of any of that.  I mean, if you're going to take a stab at it, you should go and use your mind to

Movie 2:
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?Yes, Your Majesty.Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.God... That's in a week!That's what it says.How did you manage it?With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.Why do you wish to sail west?To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.How can you be so certain?The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...Esdras is a Jew.So was Christ!Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.I'll try to remember that, Marchena...Father Marchena!Passion is something one cannot control!You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.I could be gone for years.I know.I haven't given you much of a life.Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...Are we going to argue?I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...I find that hard to believe.You say Asia can be found by sailing west?Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?I am, Your EminenceThen you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who are not our friends. I am not willing to see the whole of Europe fall apart. Why?  Because, you know, we haven't seen the last of the pirates.  That's why I want to make sure we keep the peace. And I'll give you my blessing.You'll be here for one more voyage.  And now, you're prepared to take a break.  But, you know, we are not sure we'll be able to get back to the Bahamas...

A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.Excuse me?So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't told you my name I mean, in my life I woulda wanted to have a gun so badly I'da pulled it out of my mouth and shot it.  That woulda been the end of it.  The gun shot up.  I saw this kid get shot.  I saw the kids get shot in the head and they were dead.  The guy get shot, he got shot but he got shot in the head.  That was the end of it.  I

But, as this is a case in which he was a victim, I feel this is a case of misconduct in the most appalling way possible.  I'll be here when I'm asked to attend, but I'm not going to be a party to any such meeting.  I'm not going to be asked to attend. I'm not allowed to even attend meetings of any kind.  I'm not allowed to even talk with anyone about my business.  I'm going to be at your home as
